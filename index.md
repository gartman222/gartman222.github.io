## PRICING 
$10 USD gets you a 64x64 full body sprite (Like the many rabbits on display) or a 92x92 headshot, perfect for an avatar!
For full body sprites, there's also the option of getting it animated, which will cost an extra 1 dollar per frame!  (Depending on the complexity, this price can vary.  You will be informed of any price change before hand.)
All payment transactions will be using paypal!  I'm sure other sites are trustworthy but that's the one I already have and know how to use!
Thanks for taking a look at these *sweet sweet deals* and have an excellent rest of your day.
